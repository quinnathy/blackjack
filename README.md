# blackjack
## a simple and straightforward game of blackjack in python!

in this version of pythonized blackjack, you can:
- bet "money" from your bank
- go as many rounds as you want before the scores tally up
- realize just how much you actually like playing blackjack and keep losing to the dealer, despite it being a program that a) you coded and b) is not complex and all, and runs exclusively on if/else loops for the algorithm
- (was that too specific?)

enjoy risk-free gambling! üÉè (<- not featured in the game)
